/**
 This is a simple observable that allows you to observe Values on specific type.  It's designed to act as a container that will notify via callbacks whenever it's contents has changed.  This allows for a React style of programming.
 
 There are two types of callbacks, attached callbacks and transient callbacks.  Transient callbacks (set by using `onNext(_)`) are called once on the next change and then removed.  Attached callbacks remain attached to the observable until the callback returns `false`.  This allows the callback to determine how long it should be attached to the observable.  A common use case for this is to use a weak capture list to include the observing object.  If the observing object is `nil`, then return `false` to remove the callback.
 
 Note: You cannot instantiate an `Observable` directly.  You must do so using the `MObservable` subclass.  This separates out readability from writability, enabling you to return `Observable` items that can't be mutated by the observers.  Of course, if you wish to allow the observers to modify, return the `MObservable` subclass instead.
